Once upon a time, there was
a little dog named Ratchet.
He liked to get muddy and
track dirt all over the house.
He also liked to play with
stuffed animals.  He would
play and play until there was
stuffing everywhere.  Sometimes
he would play with the couch
cushions.  One day, his master
came home with a shotgun.
The end.
